# Phishing_Website_Detection
Phishing Website Detection by using some Machine Learning Technique.

A phishing website (sometimes called a "spoofed" site) tries to steal your account password or other confidential information by tricking you into believing you're on a legitimate website. The objective of this project is to train machine learning models and deep neural nets on the dataset created to predict phishing websites. Both phishing and benign URLs of websites are gathered to form a dataset and from them required URL and website content-based features are extracted. The performance level of each model is measured and compared.
